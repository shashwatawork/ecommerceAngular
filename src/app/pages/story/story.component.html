  <h1>Our Story</h1>
  <p>
    Alankar was born from a passion for celebrating the vibrant traditions and timeless elegance of Indian ethnic wear. Our journey began with a simple vision: to bring the finest handcrafted sarees, lehengas, kurtas, and accessories to those who cherish culture and craftsmanship.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the years, we have collaborated with skilled artisans and designers across India, ensuring every piece in our collection reflects authenticity, quality, and artistry. Each garment tells a storyâ€”of heritage, creativity, and the enduring beauty of Indian textiles.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, Alankar stands as a trusted destination for ethnic fashion, blending classic styles with modern sensibilities. We are grateful to our customers for being part of our journey and for allowing us to be a part of their special moments.
